# Sum Tree
# Return true if, for every node X in the tree other than the leaves, its value is equal to the sum of its left subtree's value and its right subtree's value. 
# Else return false.
# An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. 
# A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.
